  introduction: "Hi, my name is Austin Malmberg.  I love camping and hiking, but outdoor gear can get expensive and I'm forced to work to support my passion.  I can't usually take off work to go camping so I'm forced to do it on weekends, hence the name, The Weekend Camper.",

  remember_me: "Back before cell phones were around and there was usually only a single computer per household, I wrote a batch file to restart my computer. Being the \"1337 hacker\" I thought I was, I immediately copied it to the Startup folder, restarted the computer manually, and then scrambled frantically for about 30 minutes to fix the boot loop I had created before my brother got home and found out.",
